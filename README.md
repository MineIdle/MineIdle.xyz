# MineIdle

**MineIdle** is a modern, web-based control panel for managing multiple Minecraft accounts on private or authorized servers. It allows users to launch lightweight, headless Minecraft sessions in the cloud, simulate presence, automate idle behaviors, and monitor real-time activity all from a user friendly dashboard.

Designed for reliability, scalability, and ease of use, MineIdle is ideal for users who want their Minecraft accounts to remain online 24/7 without keeping their PC running.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è MineIdle is currently in **active development** and is intended for **personal or authorized use only**. All features are developed in compliance with Mojang‚Äôs [End User License Agreement (EULA)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) and [Usage Guidelines](http://aka.ms/mcusageguidelines).

##  Overview

MineIdle lets users securely authenticate their Minecraft accounts via Microsoft OAuth2 and launch idle sessions on trusted servers. These sessions are managed through an interactive dashboard and are perfect for testing, presence simulation, or server maintenance roles.

Each session operates without rendering the Minecraft client and consumes minimal system resources. All settings are stored per user and persist between sessions.

## ‚òÅ Hosting & Scaling Strategy

MineIdle is designed for **cloud deployment** and will run on **dedicated VPS infrastructure or scalable cloud services** depending on demand.

Initial launch will be deployed on high-uptime VPS instances, with long-term plans to support:

- Horizontal scaling via Docker/Kubernetes
- Load balancing per user session cluster
- Geo-distributed nodes for latency-sensitive performance

Users will manage their accounts from anywhere through **https://mineidle.xyz**.
