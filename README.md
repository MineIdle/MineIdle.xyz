# MineIdle

**MineIdle** is a secure, web-based platform designed to help users manage their own Minecraft accounts efficiently. It allows individuals to launch lightweight, headless Minecraft sessions via a browser controlled dashboard ideal for staying connected to personal or authorized servers without running the full Minecraft client locally.

> ⚠️ MineIdle is in active development. It is intended strictly for **personal or authorized use only** and fully complies with Mojang’s [EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) and [Usage Guidelines](http://aka.ms/mcusageguidelines) to the best of its ability.

---

## Overview

MineIdle enables users to securely authenticate their Minecraft accounts via Microsoft OAuth2 and manage session behavior from a personal dashboard. These sessions consume minimal resources and are ideal for testing, keeping farms loaded, or simulating idle activity on servers where alternate accounts are allowed.

---

## Key Features

- **Web Dashboard** – Manage Minecraft accounts via an intuitive UI
- **Microsoft Login (OAuth2)** – Secure login flow with refresh token support
- **Idle / Anti-AFK** – Configure behaviors like movement, jumping, looking, etc.
- **Auto-Reconnect** – Recover from disconnects automatically
- **World Event Messages** – Custom messages on join, respawn, or world change
- **Live Coordinates** – Track position in real time (X, Y, Z)
- **Proxy Support** – Route connections via SOCKS5 or HTTPS proxies
- **Persistent User Settings** – Per-user config stored securely in the database

## ☁ Hosting & Scaling

MineIdle is built for deployment on modern infrastructure and will initially run on dedicated VPS instances. As demand increases, we plan to support:

- Docker-based horizontal scaling (if needed)
- Kubernetes orchestration (if needed)
- Geo-distributed deployment for latency optimization (if needed)

All users access the service securely via [https://mineidle.xyz](https://mineidle.xyz), managing their sessions from anywhere.

---

## Subscription Model

MineIdle is offered as a **monthly subscription service**. Each user can:

- Register securely on the platform
- Add and authenticate their own Minecraft accounts
- Configure behaviors and proxy use per account
- Launch and monitor idle sessions in real time

> Subscription tiers will be announced at public launch. The service is currently in private alpha.
